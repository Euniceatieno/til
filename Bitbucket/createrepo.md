# Creating repositories on bitbucket.
 + This involved accesing of my bitbucket account  
   and creating a repo under the create button.  
 + The platform guides you in setting up some configurations  
   for instance :git ,readme and setting the repository as public or private  
 + Eventually it allows you to create the repository.  
## Cloning a bitbucket repository
The platform allows for cloning through two menthods 
 + https - requires you to have your bitbucket account password in order to clone  
   or push work to your bitbucket repository.
 + ssh - This requires you to set up an ssh key that will be used whenever you  
   need to clone or push work to bitbucket repositories
