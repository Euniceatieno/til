* Go is a statically typed programming language( meaning before the program  
 executes ,the type associated to each vatiable must be known)

* In statically typed languages ,type errors are caight before  
 run-time(during compile time) while in dynamically typed languages,,type-errors are caught during runtime

* Garbage collection in Go is the process of freeing up memory space  
  allocated for variables that are no longer needed in the program.  
  This feature in go lang does away with the hussle of having to manually manage memory.  

* Go lang is relatively fast compared to most programming languages because it directly compiled to machine code.  

* Go has the ability to handle multiple tasks at 1 go using the goroutines  
Goroutines are functions that run in the background ehile the rest of the programming is running.  
* Goroutines suppor concurrency in Go programs.

# CHANNELS AND GOROUTINES
* Channels allow goroutines to communicate with each other\
* Channels provide a way to synchronize the execution of multiple Goroutines.
